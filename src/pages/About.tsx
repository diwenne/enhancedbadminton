          Founded in 2015, Enhanced Badminton Club was born from a passion for the sport and a desire to create a central hub for badminton in Vancouver. We envisioned a place where beginners could fall in love with the game and elite athletes could hone their skills to compete on the world stage.

          Our mission is simple: to provide the best possible environment for badminton to thrive. This means investing in top-tier facilities, attracting world-class coaches, and fostering a community that is welcoming, supportive, and driven by a shared love for the sport. We believe in nurturing talent, promoting sportsmanship, and making badminton accessible to everyone.
